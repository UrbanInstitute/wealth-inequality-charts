By 2013, the average wealth of white families was over $500,000 higher than the average wealth of African American families ($95,000) and of Hispanic families ($112,000). Put another way, white families on average had seven times the wealth of African American families and six times the wealth of Hispanic families in 2013. The ratio of white to African American or Hispanic family wealth remained extremely high over this period and deteriorated in recent years.

                <p>Why is the racial wealth gap so big? People with lower earnings may have a harder time saving. The typical white person earns $2 million over a lifetime, while the typical African American earns $1.5 million and the typical Hispanic person earns $1 million. These disparities partly reflect historical racial disadvantages that continue to affect later generations.

                <p>African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to own homes and have less in liquid retirement savings, so they more often miss out on these powerful wealth-building tools. Homeownership, in particular, makes the most of automatic payments—homeowners must make mortgage payments every month—to build equity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1983, 68 percent of white families owned their home, compared with 45 percent of African Americans families and 41 percent of Hispanic families. By 2013, the racial homeownership gap improved slightly for Hispanics, but it grew worse for African Americans. African Americans and Hispanics were also less likely to own homes than whites at the same income level.

    Notes:</b> 2013 dollars. Liquid retirement savings include dollars in accounts such as 401(k), 403(b), and IRAs. Median liquid retirement savings for African American and Hispanic families were zero from 1989 to 2013. Median liquid retirement savings for whites were zero through the mid-1990s, about $1,500 in 1998, and $5,000 in 2013.</p>

                <p>In 2013, white families had over $100,000 more (or 7 to 11 times more) in average liquid retirement savings than African American and Hispanic families. In sheer dollar terms, this disparity quadrupled over the past quarter-century: in 1989, white families had $25,000 more (or five times more) in average retirement savings than African American and Hispanic families. This gap is becoming more important as liquid retirement savings vehicles, like 401(k)s, replace more traditional defined-benefit pension plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why does this gap exist? It’s not just income differences; even at the same income level, gaps remain. African American and Hispanic families have less access to retirement saving vehicles and lower participation when they have access. But lower access and participation isn’t the full story. African American workers are somewhat less likely to participate in employer retirement plans than white workers (40 percent versus 47 percent in 2013, respectively) but have much lower average liquid retirement savings. This suggests that simply having more employers offer retirement plans will not be enough to close the gap, especially if lower-income groups contribute smaller portions of their income to retirement plans and have a greater likelihood of withdrawing money early to cover financial emergencies. Lower-income families may also get lower returns on average if they invest in safer, more short-term assets.

                <p>Since the mid-2000s, African American families, on average, have carried more student loan debt than white families. This is driven in large part by the growing share of African American families that take on student debt. In 2013, 42 percent of African Americans ages 25 to 55 had student loan debt, compared with 28 percent of whites.</p>

                <p>Because African American families, on average, have less wealth and fewer private resources, they may be more likely to turn to loans to finance their education. <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-financial-support-and-inheritance-contribute-racial-wealth-gap">White families are five times more likely than African American families to receive large gifts or inheritances</a>, which can be used to pay for college.</p>

                <p>However, African Americans also have <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_326.10.asp">lower graduation</a>  <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_326.20.asp">rates than whites</a>, and people of color <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014083.pdf">disproportionately attend</a>  <a href="http://www.responsiblelending.org/student-loans/research-policy/do-students-of-color-profit-from-for-profit-college.html">for-profit schools</a>, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.26.1.165">which have low graduation rates</a>. This means that student loan debt doesn’t always translate into a degree that would promote economic mobility—and income and wealth—in the long run.</p>

                <p>The federal government spent <a href="http://www.urban.org/publications/413241.html">$384 billion to support asset development in 2013</a>, but those subsidies primarily benefited higher-income families—<a href="http://blog.metrotrends.org/2015/02/tax-code-time/" target="_blank">exacerbating wealth inequality</a> and racial wealth disparities.</p>

                <p>About two-thirds of homeownership tax subsidies and retirement subsidies go to the top 20 percent of taxpayers, as measured by income. The bottom 20 percent, meanwhile, receive less than 1 percent of these subsidies. African Americans and Hispanics, who have lower average incomes, receive much less of these subsidies than whites, both in total amount and as a share of their incomes.</p>

                <p>Low-income families benefit from safety net programs, such as food stamps and welfare, but most of these programs focus on income—keeping families afloat today—and do not encourage wealth-building and economic mobility in the long run. What’s more, many programs discourage saving: for instance, when families won’t qualify for benefits if they have a few thousand dollars in assets or when they have to give up rent subsidies to own a home.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Limit the mortgage interest tax deduction and use the revenues to provide a credit for first-time homebuyers.</li>
                    <li>Establish automatic savings in retirement plans.</li>
                    <li>Offer matched savings such as universal children's savings accounts.</li>
                    <li>Reform safety net program asset tests, which can act as barriers to saving among low-income families.</li>
                    <li>Promote emergency savings with incentives linked to savings at tax time.</li>
                    <li>Reduce reliance on student loans while supporting success in postsecondary education.</li>
