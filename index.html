                <p>These changes have increased wealth inequality significantly. In 1963, families near the top had six times the wealth (or, $6 for every $1) of families in the middle. By 2016, they had 12 times the wealth of families in the middle.

Both are important sides of families&rsquo; financial security, but wealth cushions families against emergencies and gives them the means to move up the economic ladder. Also, wealth disparities are much greater than income disparities: three times as much by one measure.</p>

Focusing on private income, such as earnings and dividends, plus cash government benefits, we see that the income of families near the top increased roughly 90 percent from 1963 to 2016, while the income of families at the bottom increased less than 10 percent.</p>

In 1963, the average wealth of white families was $121,000 higher than the average wealth of nonwhite families. By 2016, the average wealth of white families ($919,000) was over $700,000 higher than the average wealth of black families ($140,000) and of Hispanic families ($192,000).

                Put another way, white family wealth was seven times greater than black family wealth and five times greater than Hispanic family wealth in 2016. Despite some fluctuations over the past five decades, this disparity is as high or higher than was in 1963.

                <p>Why is the racial and ethnic wealth gap so big? People with lower earnings may have a harder time saving. The average white man earns $2.7 million over a lifetime, while the average black man earns $1.8 million and the average Hispanic man earns $2.0 million. The difference in lifetime earnings is lower for women: the average white woman earns $1.5 million, while the average black woman earns $1.3 million and the average Hispanic woman earns $1.1 million. These disparities partly reflect historical disadvantages that continue to affect later generations.

                <p>In 1976, 68 percent of white families owned their home, compared with 44 percent of black families and 43 percent of Hispanic families. By 2016, the homeownership gap had narrowed slightly for Hispanics but widened for blacks. Black and Hispanic families were also less likely to own homes than white families with similar incomes.

    Notes:</b> 2016 dollars. Liquid retirement savings include dollars in accounts such as 401(k), 403(b), and IRAs.

                <p>In 2016, white families had about $130,000 more (or six times more) in average liquid retirement savings than black and Hispanic families. In sheer dollar terms, this disparity has increased more than fivefold over the past quarter-century: in 1989, white families had about $25,000 more (or five times more) in average retirement savings than black and Hispanic families. This gap is becoming more important as liquid retirement savings vehicles, like 401(k)s, replace more traditional defined-benefit pension plans.
                </p>
                <p><a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/low-pension-participation-among-minorities-contributes-wealth-gap">Why does this gap exist</a>? It&rsquo;s not just income differences; even at the same income level, gaps remain. Black and Hispanic families have less access to retirement saving vehicles and lower participation when they have access. But lower access and participation isn&rsquo;t the full story. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Black workers are somewhat less likely to participate in employer retirement plans than white workers (<a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/low-pension-participation-among-minorities-contributes-wealth-gap">40 percent versus 47 percent in 2013</a>, respectively) but have much lower average liquid retirement savings. This suggests that simply having more employers offer retirement plans will not be enough to close the gap, especially if lower-income groups contribute smaller portions of their income to retirement plans and are more likely to withdraw money early to cover financial emergencies. Lower-income families may also get lower returns on average if they invest in safer, shorter-term assets.

                <p>Since the mid-2000s, black families, on average, have carried more student loan debt than white families. This is driven in large part by the growing share of black families that take on student debt. In 2016, 42 percent of families headed by black adults ages 25 to 55 had student loan debt, compared with 34 percent of similar white families.</p>

                <p>Because black families, on average, have less wealth and fewer private resources, they may be more likely to turn to loans to finance their education. <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-financial-support-and-inheritance-contribute-racial-wealth-gap">White families are five times more likely than black families to receive large gifts or inheritances</a>, which can be used to pay for college.</p>

                <p>However, black students also have <a target = "_blank" href = "https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_326.10.asp">lower graduation rates</a> than white students. Student loan debt doesn&rsquo;t always translate into a degree that promotes economic mobility&mdash;and income and wealth&mdash;in the long run.</p>

                <p>About two-thirds of homeownership tax subsidies and retirement subsidies go to the top 20 percent of taxpayers, as measured by income. The bottom 20 percent, meanwhile, receive less than 1 percent of these subsidies. Blacks and Hispanics, who have lower average incomes, receive much less of these subsidies than whites, both in total amount and as a share of their incomes.</p>

                <p>Low-income families benefit from safety net programs, such as food and cash assistance, but most of these programs focus on income&mdash;keeping families afloat today&mdash;and do not encourage wealth-building and economic mobility in the long run. What&rsquo;s more, many programs discourage saving: for instance, when families won&rsquo;t qualify for benefits if they have a few thousand dollars in assets or when they have to give up rent subsidies to own a home.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Limit the mortgage interest tax deduction and use the revenues to provide a credit for first-time homebuyers.</li>

                    <li>Offer universal children's savings accounts.</li>
                    <li>Reform safety net program asset tests, which can act as barriers to saving among low-income families.</li>
                    <li>Provide subsidies to promote emergency savings, such as those linked to tax time.</li>
